### Hello!

Hi there, thank you for taking the time to look at my website! I really appreciate it and am grateful for it. 
I've wanted to join Strava and work as part of your engineering team since the beginning of my undergraduate program, when I started using Strava. 
I've fallen in love with the community online, and what Strava represents. 

### Tech behind IshwarLovesStrava

I've built the website from scratch using ReactJs. Please feel free to go through it and share feedback if you would like. I would really appreciate that.
